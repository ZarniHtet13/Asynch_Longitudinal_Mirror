### Overview

This README will work through the code and data files this project generate. For each code file, there will be a short description of how this fits into the larger project. Under each code file section, there will be an explanation of what each chunk within the code file does so the reader/user may easily navigate to the particular code section. 

#### Data Files Overview

- `data/raw` contains the raw data file.
- `data/processing` contains the data files in working stage.
- `data/intermediate` contains the data files that are used for intermediate analysis such as missing data exploration, unmatched/matched variables dataframes etc.
- `data/final` contains the final output data sets to be used in other analysis code files.
